# StandUp-Now


Hello everyone, this term we will work together to analyze the data collected in the StandUp project and to see if there is any relationship in reduction in sitting time and motion pattern.

This github group is for discussion and file sharing. You can post any problem you meet during your work here and share your R codes and drafts here.
